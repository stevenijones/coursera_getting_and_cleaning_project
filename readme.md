This repo is for a course taken on Coursera on Data Science - module "Getting and Cleaning Data"

run_analysis.R is a script that works in the R language on the data found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

It produces a tidy data set, that is well labelled in a text format called:
tidydata.txt
and another with means for each subject and activity in:
tidydatameans.txt

code book.md describes the variables in the resulting files
